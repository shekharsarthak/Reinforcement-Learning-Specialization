This week you will identify key parameters that affect the performance of your agent. The goal is to understand the space of options, to later enable you to choose which parameter you will investigate in-depth for your agent.

Learning Objectives

Discuss the meta-parameter choices that you will have to make to fully implement the agent.
Decide on the function approximator
Understand choices in the optimizer for updating the action-values and how to do exploration
